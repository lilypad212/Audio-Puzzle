    <h1>Audio Puzzle Write-Up</h1>
    <p>I took inspiration from the <a href=http://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/puzzle/mit2013319>Pulse Pulse Wave Noise</a>.
       puzzle. Instead of having the solver download the file and use software of their own (such as Audacity) to solve the puzzle, I implemented a
       basic audio player with functioning play, stop, and mute buttons.
       The part that I kept from the original puzzle
       was the idea of having a bunch of audio clips that you can slide around and somehow make them fit with
       each other. However, I made it easier by having an original clip with segments of it missing so that the solver has
       to fit the given segments into the correct gaps, sort of like finishing a half-solved jigsaw puzzle. </p>
